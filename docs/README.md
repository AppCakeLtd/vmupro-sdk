# VMU Pro LUA SDK Documentation

Welcome to the VMU Pro LUA SDK documentation. This comprehensive guide will help you build amazing applications for the VMU Pro using LUA.

## What is the VMU Pro LUA SDK?

The VMU Pro LUA SDK is a powerful scripting environment that allows developers to create applications for the VMU Pro device using the LUA programming language. The SDK provides access to graphics, audio, input, and file system APIs for building interactive applications.

## Key Features

- **Rich APIs**: Access to graphics, audio, input, and file system functionality
- **Easy Development**: Simple tooling for packaging and deploying applications
- **Cross-Platform Development**: Develop on any platform that supports Python and LUA
- **Advanced Graphics**: Support for layers, effects, blitting, and collision detection
- **Comprehensive File I/O**: Read and write files for save data and assets

## Quick Start

1. **Setup**: Install the required tools and dependencies
2. **Hello World**: Create your first LUA application
3. **Package**: Use the packer tool to create a .vmupack file
4. **Deploy**: Send your application to the VMU Pro device

## API Categories

The SDK provides several categories of functionality:

- **Graphics**: Drawing primitives, text rendering, and display management
- **Blitting**: Advanced buffer operations, transformations, and effects
- **Audio**: Volume control and audio input monitoring
- **Input**: Button reading and event handling
- **File System**: File and folder operations (limited to `/sdcard` directory)
- **Utilities**: Timing, system information, and helper functions
- **Layers**: Multi-layer rendering and compositing
- **Effects**: Visual effects and color manipulation
- **Collision**: Sprite and pixel-perfect collision detection
- **Double Buffer**: Smooth rendering without flicker
