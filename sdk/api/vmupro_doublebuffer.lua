--- Double buffer rendering system for smooth animation on VMU Pro.
--- All double buffer functions are available globally in the LUA environment.

--- @brief Start the double buffer rendering system
--- @usage vmupro_start_double_buffer_renderer()
--- @note Call this at the beginning of your application for smooth rendering
--- @note This is a stub definition for IDE support only.
---       Actual implementation is provided by VMU Pro firmware at runtime.
function vmupro_start_double_buffer_renderer() end

--- @brief Stop the double buffer rendering system
--- @usage vmupro_stop_double_buffer_renderer()
--- @note Call this when your application exits
--- @note This is a stub definition for IDE support only.
---       Actual implementation is provided by VMU Pro firmware at runtime.
function vmupro_stop_double_buffer_renderer() end

--- @brief Push the current frame to the double buffer
--- @usage vmupro_push_double_buffer_frame()
--- @note Call this after rendering a complete frame to display it
--- @note This is a stub definition for IDE support only.
---       Actual implementation is provided by VMU Pro firmware at runtime.
function vmupro_push_double_buffer_frame() end

--- @brief Pause the double buffer renderer
--- @usage vmupro_pause_double_buffer_renderer()
--- @note Use this to temporarily pause rendering (e.g., during menu screens)
--- @note This is a stub definition for IDE support only.
---       Actual implementation is provided by VMU Pro firmware at runtime.
function vmupro_pause_double_buffer_renderer() end

--- @brief Resume the double buffer renderer
--- @usage vmupro_resume_double_buffer_renderer()
--- @note Use this to resume rendering after pausing
--- @note This is a stub definition for IDE support only.
---       Actual implementation is provided by VMU Pro firmware at runtime.
